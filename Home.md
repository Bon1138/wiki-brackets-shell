brackets-shell is the beginnings of a new CEF3-based application shell for Brackets. It is **not** ready for use yet, so please continue to use the existing [brackets-app](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-app) shell until further notice.

If you are interested in contributing to this shell, let us know on the [brackets-dev Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev), or on the [#brackets channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=brackets).
